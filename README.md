## Detailed Project Description

The **Monte Carlo Trading Simulation Script** allows traders to simulate various trading scenarios and estimate potential outcomes based on different Forex strategies. By adjusting parameters such as starting balance, win rate, average gain, and average loss, users can visualize how these factors impact overall profitability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MalfiRG/MonteForex.git
cd MonteForex
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Simulation

Edit the `config.json` file to set your desired simulation parameters. Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
    "starting_balance": 56000,
    "win_rate": 0.5,
    "average_gain": 600,
    "average_loss": 380,
    "num_simulations": 10000,
    "num_trades": 3000
}
```

### 5. Run the Simulation

Run the simulation by executing the script:

```sh
python MonteCarloSimulation.py
```

### 6. View Results

The script will display statistics and generate plots of the simulation results. Ensure you have a graphical interface available to view these plots.

## Usage Examples

Here are some example commands and expected outputs when using this project:

```sh
# Command to run the simulation
python MonteCarloSimulation.py

# Expected output
Simulation complete. Results saved to results/output.png.
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions:

- **Configuration Errors**: Ensure that `config.json` is correctly formatted and contains all required fields.
- **Dependency Issues**: Verify that all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
